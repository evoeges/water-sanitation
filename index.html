					Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in. There is
					sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. But due to bad economics or poor
					infrastructure, <strong> every year millions of people, most of them children, die from diseases
					associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene.</strong>  Water scarcity, poor water
					quality and inadequate sanitation negatively impact food security, livelihood choices and
					educational opportunities for poor families across the world. Drought afflicts some of the
					world’s poorest countries, worsening hunger and malnutrition.

					Water is essential for life, health and human dignity. In extreme emergency situations, <strong> there
					may not be sufficient water available to meet basic needs and in these cases, supplying a
					minimum level of safe drinking-water for survival is of critical importance. </strong>
					People use water for a wide variety of activities. Some of these are more important than
					others. Having a few litres of water to drink each day, for example, is more important than
					having water for personal hygiene or laundry, but people will still want and need to wash for
					the prevention of skin diseases and meeting other physiological needs. Other uses of water
					have health and other benefits but decrease in urgency.

				<h2> What would it cost if we don’t correct the problem? </h2>
				<p>
					The costs are huge – both for people and for the economy. Worldwide, more than <strong> 2 million
					people die every year from diarrhoeal diseases. </strong> Poor hygiene and unsafe water are
					responsible for nearly 90% of these deaths and mostly affect children. The economic impact
					of not investing in water and sanitation costs an enormous <strong> 4.3% of sub-Saharan African GDP. </strong>
					The World Bank estimates that 6.4% of India’s GDP is lost due to adverse economic impacts
					and costs of inadequate sanitation. Without better infrastructure and management, many
					millions of people will continue to die every year and there will be further losses in
					biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, undermining prosperity and efforts towards a more
					sustainable future.

				<h2> What would it cost to correct the problem? </h2>
				<p>
					A study by the World Bank Group, UNICEF and the World Health Organization estimates that
					extending basic water and sanitation services to the unserved would cost USD 28.4 billion
					per year from 2015 to 2030, or <strong> 0.10% of the global product of the 140 countries </strong> included in
					its study.

				<h2>What Has UNICEF WASH done?</h2>
				<p>
				UNICEF’s water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) team works in <strong> over 100 countries  </strong> worldwide
				to improve water and sanitation services, as well as basic hygiene practices. Over the last 15
				years, UNICEF has led a global effort to improve water, sanitation and hygiene conditions for
				millions of people worldwide. In 2010, a full five years ahead of schedule, the target for
				water within Millennium Development Goals was met. <strong> Today, 91% of the world’s population
				has access to clean drinking water and 68% use improved sanitation  </strong> (a facility that separates
				human waste from human contact). <br> <br>

				However, development efforts made during the Millennium Development Goal era failed to
				reach millions of children in poor and rural communities. As a result, massive inequalities
				exist between those with access to clean water and basic toilets, and those without. In the
				pursuit of the new Sustainable Development Goals and fulfilling the rights of children,
				UNICEF works to reach the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children.

				<h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
				<p>Civil society organizations should work to keep governments accountable, invest in water
